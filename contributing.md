<!-- This right here is the ToC snippet -->

## Contributing
Contributing is easy! Just copy the `skeleton.md` file found at the root directory into the appropriate folder according to the *domain* and *principle* of the content you wish to add, fill out the *front matter* according to the instructions in the comments, and your content will automatically be available for everyone to see

## Autogenerated Table of Contents
Using Markdown's title syntax, all headings (lines starting with `#`) will be automatically added to the table of contents snippet. Different levels of subheadings will be displayed accordingly

### Example
Because the previous heading started with `##`, and this one starts with `###`, this should appear as a sub-item of *Autogenerated Table of Contents* in the Table of Contents
