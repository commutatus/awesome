*Secure Sockets Layer* (**SSL**) is a protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private documents via the Internet. SSL uses a cryptographic system that uses two keys to encrypt data âˆ’ a public key known to everyone and a private or secret key known only to the recipient of the message. 

Following are the ways we apply SSL in various frameworks.

- ***RAILS***

SSL can be configured on a rails stack from cloud66 console using the following steps.

1. On the stack page, add an `Add-In` from the Add-Ins menu.
